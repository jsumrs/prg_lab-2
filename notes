Bugs:
	- Decimals fuck everything up (generally when decimals aren't lined up, including numbers without a decimal point).
		- Things work fine for most things now except when adding a number with a decimal, and a number without one aka when decimal is not aligned.
		- I've tried padding the numbers before adding but it fucks with carry adds.
		- Previously decimal was instead a -2 and handled accordingly.
		- I need a new way to track the decimal.

Program should pass each property of multiplication:
Commutative:
	a x b = b x a
Associative:
	a x (b x c) = a (b x c)
Distributive:
	a x (b + c) = (a x b) + (a x c)
	a x (b - c) = (a x b) - (a x c)
Identity:
	a x 1 = a
Zero:
	a x 0 = 0

Program should pass each property of addition:
Commutative:
	a + b = b + a
Associative:
	a + (b + c) = a (b + c)
Distributive:
	a x (b + c) = (a x b) + (a x c)
Additive:
	a + 0 = a
Opposites:
	a + (-a) = 0
	
Time permitting, a program should be written to test each of these properties.
